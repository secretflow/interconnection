# Interconnection

This repo aims to define standard interconnection protocols for multi-layers in
privacy-preserving computing.

It's now just for experimental purposes. Everything might get changed here.

Currently supported protocols:

- Transport layer protocol
- ECDH-PSI protocol
- SS-LR protocol
- SGB protocol
